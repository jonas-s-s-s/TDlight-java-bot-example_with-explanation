# TDlight java bot example (with explanation)

This is a full example code for running a **standard bot** with TDlight. Basically the only things you have to change in order to get it running are the APP ID, Hash, and your bot token. (Change this in the "Static_config" files)

The benefits of using TDlight for bot creation are mainly the ability to dowload/upload files larger than 30 MB and also the ability to receive MessageDeleted events. You can also still use the java "Telegrambots" library in the same program, if you wish to.
